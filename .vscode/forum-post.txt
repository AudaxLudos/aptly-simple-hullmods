1.0.0 is incompatible with older versions

[hr]

Adds a few hullmods to the game, hullmods are obtainable through exploration or buying them from factions. 

I have balance the hullmods the best I could based on my experience with vanilla and modded starsector, so the hullmods should blend with vanilla and modded starsector games. S mods effects are balance to not be an instant grab but more of a slight increase in power or defense.

If you have any problems or suggestions just post them and I'll try to implement / fix them as soon as I can.

Update: Added s-mod effects for when you s-mod the hullmods, also added an option for disabling s-mod effects in the settings
