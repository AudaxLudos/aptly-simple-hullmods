### TODO:
- [x] Change temporal flux reactor
  - [x] Increase ordnance points to 6/12/18/30 from 5/10/15/25
  - [x] Remove peak performance penalty
- [ ] Remove reactive shield
- [ ] Add condensed shield
  - [ ] Add shield strength buff of 10%
  - [ ] Add flat shield arc penalty of 40 degrees
- [ ] Remove subverted shields
- [ ] Add Channeled Vents
  - [ ] Add scaling effect based on the ship's shield arc that increases the hard flux dissipation when shields are active by up to 20%
    - If the ship's shield arc is 180 gain a 10% hard flux dissipation when shields are active
